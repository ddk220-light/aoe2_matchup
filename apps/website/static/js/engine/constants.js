// Stuck-detection progress bar (moveTowardTarget), expressed as a RATE
// (px/s) rather than a bare per-substep constant. 30 px/s = 1.0 tile/s.
// At dt = 1/60 this is EXACTLY today's historical `- 0.5` literal
// (30 * (1/60) === 0.5 in IEEE-754, pinned by a test) -- a provable no-op
// at the current tick rate. Load-bearing only if dt ever changes: the old
// bare literal meant 1.0 tile/s at 60fps but 0.5 tile/s at 30Hz, silently
// coupling "stuck" semantics to the tick rate. See
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-target-thrash-design.md §2.
export const STUCK_PROGRESS_RATE = 30;

// Fraction of the ACHIEVABLE closing rate a chaser must actually deliver
// before the stuck bar (above) brands it blocked, used only while its target
// is actively kiting away. Chasing a fleeing unit closes the gap at the SPEED
// DIFFERENCE, not at the chaser's own speed, so the flat 1.0 tile/s bar is
// unreachable for every melee unit slower than 1.6 t/s chasing a 0.6 t/s
// Siege Onager -- they blacklist it every 0.8 s and never engage at all.
// A chaser that is SLOWER than its fleeing target still gets a bar of 0 and
// still blacklists normally: that is what keeps melee re-targeting off an
// uncatchable kiting archer instead of trailing it forever.
export const PURSUIT_BAR_FRACTION = 0.5;

// Minimum speed advantage (px/s) a chaser needs over its fleeing target
// before the relaxed bar applies at all. Below this the chase is not worth
// committing to -- a Champion (1.06 t/s) trailing an Arbalester (0.96 t/s)
// closes at 0.1 t/s and would need half a minute to cross three tiles, so
// blacklisting and re-targeting really IS the right behaviour there. The
// Siege Onager cases this exists for sit far above it (0.39-1.00 t/s).
export const PURSUIT_MIN_ADVANTAGE = 7.5;

// ===== GROUP-KITE STEERING (E5a) =====
// The recorded tapes' ranged sides are driven by ddkSquareV25, which -- ONLY
// while `gKiteOK` (its own range out-ranges the enemy MEDIAN) -- walks the whole
// army around a clockwise square patrol as ONE ball, with stop-and-volley
// pauses. The engine's kiters instead flee radially and individually, so the
// ball disperses, chasers lose contact, and fights run ~20% long.
// BattleUnit.kiteSteering() adds two boids-style terms on top of the existing
// radial flee + separation, ONLY for units whose side passes that same
// out-ranges gate (see kiteSteering for the exact predicate, including the
// min-range/siege exclusion that keeps every siege fight bit-identical).
//
// These three numbers are the only tuning knobs. They are weights in the same
// (unnormalised) space as calculateAvoidance's separation force, which is 0.5
// per neighbour in the 1.0-1.5x-minDist band and 3..8 per neighbour once
// overlapping -- so a weight near 1-2 is "comparable to separation", not
// "negligible" (the radial flee term is only 1.0 and is already swamped when
// crowded; that is the dispersal bug).

// Tangential (orbit) weight, BEFORE kiteSteering's speed-margin scaling. The
// flee direction is rotated off pure-radial by atan(weight): 1.0 -> 45 deg,
// 1.5 -> 56 deg, 2.0 -> 63 deg. Higher = more circling, less distance gained,
// so chasers keep contact longer.
//
// Pinned by the champion__vs__heavy_cav_archer REPEAT FAMILY -- the one place
// this weight's effect is observable against the game's own run-to-run noise.
// That matchup was recorded four times and the TAPE ITSELF disagrees: the Heavy
// Cav Archers sweep in r2/r3/r4 (9, 7 and 9 of 12 surviving) but LOSE the base
// recording (0 of 12; the champions end with 4). Ground truth is therefore "HCA
// favoured roughly 3:1", not "HCA always win". The sim's share of seeds the HCA
// take slides smoothly with this weight:
//
//     weight    1.0    1.25   1.5    1.75
//     HCA seeds 100%    95%    65%    30%      (tape family: 75%)
//
// 1.5 is the value whose SEED DISTRIBUTION lands nearest the tape's own split.
// 1.0/1.25 win the median winner in 3 of the 4 repeats but at ~100% confidence
// the tape does not support; 1.75 tips the family the other way and loses three
// winners outright. 1.5 is also the best on aggregate error over the 20-fight
// cav-archer subset (gated mismatches 125 -> 93, against 99 at 1.25 and 103 at
// 1.75). Do NOT re-tune this by minimising mismatches on the base recording
// alone: that fight is the 1-of-4 outlier, and fitting it (this experiment's
// first pass did) picks 2.5 and breaks the other three repeats.
export const KITE_TANGENTIAL_WEIGHT = 1.5;

// Cohesion weight -- pull toward the side's own living centroid. Balances
// against separation to set the formation's equilibrium spacing: too low and
// the ball disperses (today's behaviour), too high and units pile into the
// collision floor. Note the engine CANNOT reach the tape's 0.6-tile
// nearest-neighbour spacing: two 14 px-radius archers bottom out at
// radius+radius+1 = 29 px = 0.97 tiles in resolveCollisions.
//
// This term is nearly invisible to the 20-seed scorer (subset gated
// mismatches: 0.0 -> 49, 1.0 -> 50, 2.0 -> 49, 3.0 -> 48) but it is decisive
// for the tape signature the scorer cannot see. heavy_cav_archer__vs__
// elite_elephant seed 1, same tangential weight: with cohesion the ball holds
// (nearest-neighbour 1.32 -> 1.26 tiles, COMPRESSING as the tape does) and the
// fight ends at 59.7 s; without it the last survivors scatter to opposite
// corners (nearest-neighbour blows out past 20 tiles) and the fight grinds on
// to 555.6 s. Kept at 2.0 on that evidence, not on the scoreboard.

// ===== RANGED STAND-AND-SHOOT COST (E9) =====
// Measured over every tape in D:/AI/aoe2_golden/tapes (140 recordings, 21,296
// missile-launch-to-missile-launch gaps, six ranged units). Launches come from
// the ~60 Hz missile stream (first row of each projectile flight, ids split on
// a >3 s gap because the game recycles them); stationarity comes from the 10 Hz
// unit position stream.
//
// THE LAW (one rule, no per-unit tuning, no siege exception):
//
//   A ranged unit that STOOD STILL for a whole fire cycle re-fires at exactly
//   its reload time. A unit that MOVED at any point during the cycle pays a
//   stand-and-shoot cost: its shot lands on the next FIRE_CYCLE_QUANTUM
//   boundary, i.e. cycle = ceil(reload / Q) * Q.
//
// Per-shot split of all 21,296 gaps by "did this unit move during the cycle":
//
//   unit               reload  pred ceil(r/Q)*Q | stood n   median | moved n  median
//   arbalester          1.70        2.000       |   614     1.718  |  6816    2.000
//   heavy_cav_archer    1.80        2.000       |   509     1.820  |  6650    2.008
//   hand_cannoneer      3.45        4.000       |   132     3.468  |  4961    3.998
//   imp_elite_skirm     3.00        3.333       |   341     3.018  |  1705    3.334
//   heavy_scorpion      3.60        4.000       |   409     3.616  |    85    4.020
//   siege_onager        6.00        6.000       |    68     6.026  |    30    6.028
//
// Every "stood" median is reload + one tape tick; every "moved" median is the
// quantised prediction, to within 0.02 s. This is what discriminates the two
// candidate cadence models: the cost is NOT additive (additive predicts
// hand_cannoneer 3.45 + recovery 0.33 = 3.78, but the tape says 4.00, and
// predicts heavy_cav_archer 2.23 against a tape 2.006). Reload runs
// CONCURRENTLY with the post-fire recovery; the whole cadence residual is the
// quantum, so cycle = max(ceil(reload/Q)*Q, windup + recovery).
//
// Note the corollary for siege: heavy_scorpion looked exempt when its gaps were
// pooled (3.616 == reload flat) purely because it stands still for 83% of its
// shots. On the 85 shots where it DID move it quantises to 4.020 like everything
// else, so siege needs no special-casing -- the movement gate handles it.
export const FIRE_CYCLE_QUANTUM = 2 / 3;

// Stop/turn overhead paid BEFORE the shot, on top of attack_delay, whenever the
// unit had to halt to fire. Measured as (time the unit was already stationary
// when the missile launched) - attack_delay, debiased by +0.05 s for the 10 Hz
// sampling grid (an observed window is uniformly truncated over one 0.1 s bin):
//
//   arbalester +0.044 | hand_cannoneer +0.141 | heavy_cav_archer +0.173 |
//   imp_elite_skirm +0.238                                  mean +0.149
//
// One shared value covers all four to within 0.11 s, and this constant is the
// LOW-STAKES one: because the cadence is pinned by the quantum above, moving
// the overhead only shifts WHERE in the cycle the unit is frozen, never how
// often it shoots.
export const RANGED_STOP_OVERHEAD = 0.15;

// Post-fire recovery: after the missile leaves, the unit cannot move for this
// long. Measured as the time from launch to the unit's next position change,
// over kiting cycles only, same +0.05 s debias:
//
//   imp_elite_skirm 0.201 (n=1659) | arbalester 0.326 (n=6761) |
//   hand_cannoneer  0.331 (n=4882) | heavy_cav_archer 0.427 (n=6370)
//
// Unlike the two constants above this one does NOT collapse to a single value:
// the spread is better than 2x and every distribution is tight and unimodal
// (heavy_cav_archer is 0.30/0.35/0.40 = 563/2965/2519 samples, imp_elite_skirm
// is 0.05/0.10/0.15 = 605/653/166). So the default below carries the two units
// that genuinely share it and the other two are named overrides. This is the
// constant that sets a kiter's effective speed, which is the whole point of the
// experiment -- forcing heavy_cav_archer onto a shared 0.33 would hand it back
// 0.10 s of movement per 2.0 s cycle it does not have on tape.
//
// The per-slug heavy_cav_archer value was also checked ON THE SCOREBOARD, not
// just against the tape, because that unit's two families are the campaign's
// judged targets. Sweeping only this number (10 seeds x the two families):
//
//   HCA recovery      0.33     0.43 (tape)   0.55
//   halberdier win   60/60      60/60       60/60    (tape 6/6 -- unaffected)
//   champion HCA win  0/90       9/90        0/90    (tape 8/9)
//
// The response is non-monotonic and the tape-measured 0.43 is also the best of
// the three: freezing the HCA LESS makes it lose harder, because a more mobile
// kiter in this engine disperses out of its own ball and trades its DPS uptime
// for distance it does not need. So this constant is not the champion family's
// problem and cannot be its fix -- see the experiment report.
